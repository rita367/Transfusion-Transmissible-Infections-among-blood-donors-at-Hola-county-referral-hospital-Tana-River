Background: Blood transfusion is an essential therapeutic procedure. Although timely transfusion saves millions of lives worldwide each year, unsafe transfusion practices can put millions of people at risk of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs). The present study aimed to provide an update and insightful information regarding the prevalence of the common Transfusion-Transmitted Infections (TTIs) and associated factors among blood donors at Hola County referral Hospital, Tana River County, Kenya. 
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving a prospective collection of blood donors data from 300 blood donors at Hola County Referral Hospital between March and April 2020.  Serologic screening of the collected blood was done at Regional Blood Transfusion Centre (RBTC) Mombasa. We performed descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of blood donors presented in proportions, multivariate analysis and Chi-square test to determine the association between TTIs and the socio-demographic characteristics of the blood donors. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: Out of the 300 blood donors 221 (73.7%) were males while female were 79(26.3%). Of all the participants, the majority 119 (39.7%) were between 21-25 years and had a mean age of 28.9 years. Voluntary non-renumerated donors were 230 (76.7%) (while 70 (23.3%) were replacement blood donors. Two-thirds of the blood donors (200) were first-time donors while 100 were multiple donors. The overall seroprevalence of TTIs among blood donors was 11.0% (33), the most prevalent TTI was HBV at 5.7%, followed by HIV 3.0% then HCV 2.0%, and finally, syphilis had the lowest proportion of 0.3%. All socio-demographic factors were associated with any of the four routinely tested TTIs. Marital Status: Married individuals had significantly higher odds of TTI (OR=4.58, 95% CI: 2.06-10.20, p<0.001) compared to single individuals.
Conclusion 
Replacement donors were found the high-risk group and HBV was the most common pathogen. While this study provides valuable insights into TTI prevalence and donor demographics in Hola County, some findings diverge from regional trends. This underscores the importance of local, context-specific research in informing blood safety policies and interventions. Further studies are needed to explore the unexpected associations between socio-demographic factors and TTI prevalence observed in this population.

Introduction
Blood transfusion is a life-saving medical intervention that benefits millions of patients worldwide. However, it also carries the risk of transmitting various infectious agents, collectively known as Transfusion-Transmissible Infections (TTIs)(1). The most significant TTIs include Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and Syphilis (2). These infections pose substantial health risks to recipients and can lead to long-term morbidity and mortality, impacting not only the individuals but also their families and communities (3).
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an integrated strategy to enhance blood transfusion safety(4). This strategy includes establishing well-organized blood transfusion services, prioritizing voluntary non-remunerated donors, screening donated blood for at least the four major TTIs using quality-assured assays, promoting rational blood use, and implementing effective quality control systems (5). While developed countries have successfully implemented these measures, many developing countries, particularly in Africa, face challenges in uniformly applying these interventions, resulting in a higher risk of TTIs (5).
Africa faces unique challenges in blood transfusion safety, with the highest prevalence of blood-borne pathogens and the weakest transfusion programs globally (6). Most blood banks in Africa are small, hospital-based, and rely heavily on replacement donors, in contrast to Western transfusion units organized with large pools of voluntary donors. Additionally, recommended reference screening tests like Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) or Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) are often beyond the reach of resource-constrained blood banks in these settings (5).
In Kenya, while several studies have focused on TTIs, there is a lack of comprehensive data from Hola County Referral Hospital in Tana River County. Regular studies on TTIs are crucial for identifying low-risk donors and monitoring blood supply safety, especially given that screening methods are not 100% effective (7).
The primary aim of this study is to assess the seroprevalence of Transfusion-Transmissible Infections (TTIs) among blood donors at Hola County Referral Hospital in Tana River County, Kenya. This assessment is critical for monitoring the safety of the blood supply in the region, evaluating the effectiveness of current donor screening procedures, identifying trends in TTI prevalence that may inform public health interventions, and contributing to the broader understanding of TTI epidemiology in Kenya and East Africa. 
Materials and methods 
Study site
The study site was Hola County Referral Hospital in Tana River County, one of six counties in Kenya's Coast Region. Tana River County occupies 39,190.6 square kilometres and hosts a population of 315,943, consisting of 158,550 females and 157,391 males, according to the 2019 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics census. The hospital serves as a critical healthcare facility for the region, particularly in blood donation services. It screens approximately 4,000 blood donors annually for major transfusion-transmissible infections, ensuring a safe blood supply for the local community.
 Study design and data collection. 
This was a cross-sectional study involving prospective collection of blood donor data at Hola County referral hospital between March and April 2020. Hola County Hospital supplies blood to the three sub-county hospitals of Tana River County (Tana North, Galole and Tana Delta). 
The study population was all blood donors who passed questionnaire screening and consented to participate in the study. The sample size for seroprevalence of TTIs among blood donors was determined by considering the sero-prevalence of HIV (3.2%) in the KAIS survey (8). Cochran (9) formula was used to calculate sample size and a minimum sample size of 297 was obtained and rounded off to the nearest tenth value (300). Donor was deferred based on health assessment or risk assessment, age 16-55 years, and those who met eligibility criteria were recruited into the study. The rationale behind the selection of the specific age group is that those clients above the age of 16 years are termed legible donors by national blood transfusion service (NBTS). In the data collection, we interviewed blood donors using a standard national blood transfusion questionnaire which contains structured questions in three sections; demographics section, health assessment and risk assessment section.
 Data was collected in all three sections. In the demographic section, details like Age, Sex, Marital status, and Occupation were captured. In the health assessment data in relation to the donor’s haemoglobin level, blood sugar, blood pressure, physical scars, whether they have received blood transfusion, fainting, Tuberculosis, epileptic, bleeding condition and in addition for female donors, whether they are pregnant, breastfeeding, or menstruating were captured. In the risk assessment section, concerns in relation to Urinary tract infection, HIV status, body piercing or tattoo in the past 3 months, having paid sex and number of sexual partners was recorded. The eligibility criteria prioritized donor safety before patient safety. After counselling and donor education, blood collection was done and a sample was taken from each blood bag into coagulated and anti-coagulated specimen vacutainers for TTIs screening. 
Initial screening of all donors via questionnaire followed by serological screening of the four main TTIs was achieved using different assays, which apply antigen-antibody principle (Immunoassays). Confirmatory tests for all positive cases were done using specific rapid confirmatory tests and referred for molecular Assays.



 Detection of transfusion transmissible infections.

Blood samples from all eligible participants underwent a systematic screening process for four major transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) at RBTC Mombasa. For Hepatitis B detection, the Hepanostika hepatitis B surface antigen assay (Murex Biotech S.A) was employed to identify the presence of HBsAg in the samples. Concurrent testing for Hepatitis C was performed using the Murex anti-HCV version 4.0 assay, which specifically detects antibodies to the hepatitis C virus. To screen for syphilis infection, the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test from Omega Diagnostics was utilized to detect antibodies to Treponema pallidum. HIV screening encompassed both HIV-1 and HIV-2 using the Vironostika HIV uni-form II Ag/Ab assay, which detects both viral antigens and antibodies. For all four testing procedures, rigorous quality control measures were implemented, including the use of manufacturer-provided positive and negative controls, as well as known internal patient samples for result verification. This comprehensive approach ensures reliable and accurate detection of these critical TTIs in the blood supply.

Data analysis 
Data of the categorical variables collected was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. We managed missing data by running cross-tabs and frequency tables. The age of the participants was presented in mean ± standard deviation and all categorical variables (sex, category of blood donor, status of seropositivity for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis) were summarized in proportions. Association of the background characteristics with donors’ characteristics was performed using chi-square test.
Ethical approval 
We obtained ethical approval to conduct this study from Kenya Methodist University Ethical review committee, asked permission from Hola County referral hospital to collect data, and formulated a consent document for the client and also applied professional ethics in results confidentiality and code of conduct.
Results 
Background information of the blood donors in the study
A total of n=300 blood donors were included in the study of which 221(73.7%)  were males while female was 26.3%(79). Of all the participants, the majority 119 (39.7%) were between 21-25 years and had a mean age of 28.9 years. Voluntary non-renumerated donors were 76.7%(230) while 23.3%(70) were replacement blood donors. The majority of the blood donors 200 were first-time donors while 100 were multiple donors. Figure 2 and Table 1. Below is a summary.
 
 
The overall seroprevalence of TTIs among blood donors was 33 (11.0%), the most prevalent TTI was HBV 17(5.7%), followed by HIV 9(3.0%) then HCV 6(2.0%) finally syphilis had the lowest proportion of 1(0.3%). Figure 2 below.

On the multivariable analysis of the data Age: While not statistically significant overall (p=0.12), the 36-40 age group showed a notably higher risk (OR=2.35, 95% CI: 0.89-6.21) compared to other age groups. Gender: Females showed a higher risk (OR=1.93, 95% CI: 0.91-4.08) compared to males, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Marital Status: Married individuals had significantly higher odds of TTI (OR=4.58, 95% CI: 2.06-10.20, p<0.001) compared to single individuals. This strong association warrants further investigation into potential risk factors within marital relationships.
 Education Level: Surprisingly, tertiary education was associated with significantly higher odds of TTI (OR=9.18, 95% CI: 3.21-26.23, p<0.001) compared to primary education. This unexpected finding challenges assumptions about education and health awareness, suggesting a need for targeted interventions in higher education settings. Occupation: Both formal (OR=4.05, 95% CI: 1.35-12.15, p=0.01) and informal (OR=3.33, 95% CI: 1.12-9.91, p=0.03) employment were associated with significantly higher odds of TTI compared to students. This indicates that working individuals may be at higher risk, possibly due to lifestyle factors or occupational exposures. Donor Type: Replacement donors showed higher odds of TTI (OR=1.77, 95% CI: 0.82-3.84) compared to volunteer donors, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.15). Table 2 below has the summary.

Discussion
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Transfusion-Transmissible Infections (TTIs) among blood donors at Hola County Hospital in Kenya. The findings reveal important insights into the demographic characteristics of blood donors and the prevalence of various TTIs in this population.
The majority of blood donors (39.7%) were between 21-25 years old, with a mean age of 28.53 years. This aligns with findings from other studies in Kenya and Africa. For instance, a study by Bartonjo et al(1) in Nakuru, Kenya, found that most donors were in the 18-24 age group. Similarly, a study in Ethiopia by Biadgo et al(10) reported a mean age of 26.7 years among blood donors.
Male donors significantly outnumbered female donors (73.7% vs 26.3%). This gender disparity is consistent with other African studies. For example, Zezai et al (11)reported 80.5% male donors in Zimbabwe, and Yooda et al (12)  found 70.4% male donors in Burkina Faso. The lower representation of female donors could be attributed to factors such as pregnancy, lactation, and cultural beliefs, which are common barriers to female blood donation in many African countries.
The majority of donors (59.7%) had secondary education as their highest level of education. This is similar to findings by Kimani et al(13) in Nairobi, Kenya, where 54.2% of donors had secondary education. The high proportion of secondary-educated donors might reflect the demographic makeup of the region or indicate a need for more targeted awareness programs in other educational groups.
Students constituted the largest group of donors (39.7%), followed closely by the unemployed (38%). This high representation of students is consistent with other African studies, such as Yooda et al,(12) in Burkina Faso, where students made up 42.3% of donors. The high proportion of student donors could be due to increased awareness campaigns in educational institutions and the generally good health status of young adults.
The study found an overall TTI prevalence of 11% (33/300), which is concerning but not uncommon in the region. This rate is lower than some reported in other parts of Kenya, such as the 14.1% found by Bartonjo et al (1) in Nakuru, but higher than the 8.4% reported by Aurora et al, (14) in Nairobi.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) was the most prevalent TTI at 5.7%. This is lower than the 9.4% reported by Ochwoto et al (15) in a national survey of Kenya but higher than the 3.9% found by Bartonjo et al (1) in Nakuru. The high prevalence of HBV underscores the need for enhanced vaccination and screening programs.
The HIV prevalence of 3.0% is concerning, although it's lower than the 5.6% reported by Bartonjo et al (1) in Nakuru. It's important to note that this rate is higher than the national HIV prevalence in Kenya, which was estimated at 4.9% in 2017 (16).
The Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) prevalence of 2.0% is comparable to the 1.8% reported by Kimani et al (13) in Nairobi but lower than the 3.2% found by Bartonjo et al (1)in Nakuru. The syphilis prevalence of 0.3% is lower than most other reports from Kenya and Africa. For instance, Bartonjo et al (1) reported a 1.6% prevalence in Nakuru, while Zezai (11) found a 0.8% prevalence in Zimbabwe.
Interestingly, the highest TTI prevalence was observed in the 36-40 age group (20.7%). This differs from some studies where younger age groups had higher prevalence rates, such as Bartonjo et al (1), who found the highest prevalence in the 18-24 age group. Females had a higher TTI prevalence (16.1%) compared to males (9.0%), which contrasts with some other African studies where males typically show higher prevalence rates (5).
Married individuals had a significantly higher TTI prevalence (19.7%) compared to single individuals (5.1%). This finding warrants further investigation into the social and behavioral factors that might contribute to this difference. Surprisingly, those with tertiary education had the highest TTI prevalence (43.3%). This is contrary to expectations and differs from many studies where higher education is associated with lower TTI prevalence Kimani et al (13).
Formal sector workers had the highest TTI prevalence (22.6%), followed by those in informal employment (19.4%). This is an unexpected finding that requires further investigation.
The high prevalence of HBV highlights the need for enhanced vaccination programs and public health education on HBV prevention. The unexpected findings regarding education level and occupation suggest that targeted awareness and prevention programs should not overlook seemingly low-risk groups. The gender disparity in blood donation rates indicates a need for strategies to encourage more female donors while addressing potential barriers.
The high TTI prevalence among married individuals suggests a need for couple-based interventions and increased awareness about TTIs within marital relationships. Given the high proportion of student donors, there's an opportunity to further strengthen blood donation programs in educational institutions while ensuring comprehensive TTI prevention education. The overall TTI prevalence, while concerning, suggests that current screening practices are crucial and should be maintained or enhanced to ensure blood safety.
Conclusion
This study on blood donors at Hola County Hospital provided critical insights into donor demographics and the prevalence of Transfusion-Transmissible Infections (TTIs). The donor population was predominantly young and male, reflecting a pattern observed across similar African studies. The concerning overall TTI prevalence of 11%, primarily attributed to Hepatitis B Virus, emphasizes the urgent need for enhanced screening protocols and preventive measures, especially HBV vaccination.
Several unexpected findings emerged, challenging conventional assumptions about TTI risk factors. Higher TTI prevalence was found among individuals with tertiary education and those in formal employment, traditionally considered lower-risk groups. Additionally, married individuals showed increased TTI risk, suggesting the need to investigate underlying social and behavioral factors. These results indicate that awareness and intervention programs should be broadened to encompass these seemingly low-risk demographics.
Study limitation
 Responses from donors could not be verified and no efforts were made to do so. None of the family replacement donors responded positively to any of the risk factors, it is likely that risk behaviours of these blood donors were purposely denied so as not to lose face amongst family and friends who had approached the donor on behalf of a sick relative requiring transfusion. Such pressure could not be there for volunteer non- remunerated donors and also most of the RBTC-dependent donors were on holiday due to school disruption during COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear to point out that the results obtained in this study do not reflect the prevalence of markers of transfusion transmissible infections in the unselected general population because blood donors are pre-selected group and all of them are within the sexually active age group.
